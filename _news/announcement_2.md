I will take part to the [European Solid Mechanics Conference](https://esmc2025.sciencesconf.org/) in Lyon, France, 7-11 July. Thomas Cardart will present his work entitled *A PINN-based domain decomposition method for the optimal design of additively manufactured lattice structures* that I co-supervised.
