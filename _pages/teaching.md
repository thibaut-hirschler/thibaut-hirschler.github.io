I teach in the **mechanical enginnering** department at [Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) since 2023. 

## Strength of materials and vibration

I am in charge of a course on **structural mechanics**. The students learn:
* Important principles in mechanics: linear elasticity and superposition principle, partial derivatives of mechanical energies, equilibrium equations, etc.
* How standard materials behave: strain/stress relations, the concept of pasticity and failure.
* What happend in the case of dynamic loadings: vibration modes, resonance, dynamic amplification, damping.
* How to model and predict the mechanical responses of beam-like structures in both static and vibration regimes.

I compile some of the exercices in the following repository:

<!-- code for GitHub repositories
{% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %} {% include repository/repo.liquid repository=repo %} {% endfor %}

{% endif %} -->
