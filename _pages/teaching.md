I teach in the **mechanical enginnering** department at [Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) since 2023. 

## Strength of materials and vibration

I am in charge of a course on **structural mechanics**. The students learn:
* Important principles in mechanics: linear elasticity and superposition principle, partial derivatives of mechanical energies, equilibrium equations, etc.
* How standard materials behave: strain/stress relations, the concept of pasticity and failure.
* What happen in the case of dynamic loadings: vibration modes, resonance, dynamic amplification, damping.
* How to model and predict the mechanical responses of beam-like structures in both static and vibration regimes.

I compile some of the exercices in the following repository:

## Numerical methods: the bases

I am involved in a **numerical analysis** course where the students learn how to:
* Obtain and solve algebraic equations coming from static equilibrium of spring-mass systems and trusses.
* Implement standard linear algebra algorithms (using `C#` together with Visual Studio): vector and matrix products, Gaussian elimination, building stiffness matrices and applying boundary conditions, etc.
* Approximate PDE solution numerically with the Finite Element Method, from scratch (strong form to numerical results).

At the end of the course, the students are able for instance to perform FEA of a bar with varying geometric features:

## Computational mechanics

I am in charge of practical sessions of a course dedicated to **computational mechanics**. The students learn how to:
* Perform linear elasticity simulations with Abaqus FEA and Altair HyperWorks.
* Choose appropriate modelling and numerical solving procedures: constitutive laws, boundary conditions, FE discretization, postprocessing, beam VS solid, etc.
* Perform structural analyses of (simple) real-world problems, and elasto-plastic simulations (linear hardening, isotropic von Mises yield condition).


## Design methods for additive manufacturing

I sometimes take part in a course devoted to **3D printing** where the students are introduced to numerical methods for simulating and designing complex structures, as for instance :
* Shape and topology optimization.
* Homogenization (numerical) and multiscale approaches to simulate lattice structures.

A related repository which contains a jupyter notebook that enables to plot directional Young's modulus can be found here:
