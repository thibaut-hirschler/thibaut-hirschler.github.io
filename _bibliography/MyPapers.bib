  abstract = {Abstract             This paper presents a novel method for solving partial differential equations on three-dimensional CAD geometries by means of immersed isogeometric discretizations that do not require quadrature schemes. It relies on a newly developed technique for the evaluation of polynomial integrals over spline boundary representations that is exclusively based on analytical computations. First, through a consistent polynomial approximation step, the finite element operators of the Galerkin method are transformed into integrals involving only polynomial integrands. Then, by successive applications of the divergence theorem, those integrals over B-Reps are transformed into the first surface and then line integrals with polynomials integrands. Eventually, these line integrals are evaluated analytically with machine precision accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by means of numerical experiments in the context of 2D and 3D elliptic problems, retrieving optimal error convergence order in all cases. Finally, the methodology is illustrated for 3D CAD models with an industrial level of complexity.},

Based on the existing procedure of interpolation and lookup, we design a multiscale assembly procedure to reduce the exorbitant assembly time in the context of isogeometric linear elasticity of complex microstructured geometries modeled via spline compositions. The developed isogeometric approach involves a polynomial approximation occurring at the macro-scale and the use of lookup tables with pre-computed integrals incorporating the micro-scale information. We provide theoretical insights and numerical examples to investigate the performance of the procedure. The strategy turns out to be of great interest not only to form finite element operators but also to compute other quantities in a fast manner as for instance sensitivity analyses commonly used in design optimization.},

  abstract = {This work explores the use of solid-shell elements in the the framework of isogeometric shape optimization of shells. The main difference of these elements with respect to pure shell ones is their volumetric nature which can provide recognized benefits to analyze, for example, structures with non-linear behaviors. From the design point of view, we show that this geometric representation of the thickness is also of great interest since it offers new possibilities: continuous sizing variations can be imposed by modifying the distance between the control points of the outer surfaces. In other words, shape and sizing optimization can be performed in an identical manner. Firstly, we carry out a range of numerical experiments in order to carefully compare the results with the commonly adopted technique based on the Kirchhoff-Love formulation. These studies reveal that both solid-shell and Kirchhoff-Love strategies lead to very similar optimal shapes. Then, we apply a bi-step strategy to integrate shape and sizing optimization. We highlight the potential of the proposed approach on a stiffened cylinder where the cross section along the stiffener is optimized leading to a final design with smooth thickness variations. Finally, we combine the benefits of both Kirchhoff-Love and solid-shell formulations by setting up a multi-model optimization process to efficiently design a roof.},

  abstract = {Isogeometric shape optimization has been now studied for over a decade. This contribution aims at compiling the key ingredients within this promising framework, with a particular attention to sensitivity analysis. Based on all the researches related to isogeometric shape optimization, we present a global overview of the process which has emerged. The principal feature is the use of two refinement levels of the same geometry: a coarse level where the shape updates are imposed and a fine level where the analysis is performed. We explain how these two models interact during the optimization, and especially during the sensitivity analysis. We present new theoretical developments, algorithms, and quantitative results regarding the analytical calculation of discrete adjoint-based sensitivities. In order to highlight the versatility of this sensitivity analysis method, we perform eight benchmark optimization examples with different types of objective functions (compliance, displacement field, stress field, and natural frequencies), different types of isogeometric element (2D and 3D standard solids, and a Kirchhoff--Love shell), and different types of structural analysis (static and vibration). The numerical performances of the analytical sensitivities are compared with approximate sensitivities. The results in terms of accuracy and numerical cost make us believe that the presented method is a viable strategy to build a robust framework for shape optimization.},

  abstract = {Summary                            This paper addresses the overwhelming computational resources needed with standard numerical approaches to simulate architected materials. Those multiscale heterogeneous lattice structures gain intensive interest in conjunction with the improvement of additive manufacturing as they offer, among many others, excellent stiffness-to-weight ratios. We develop here a dedicated HPC solver that benefits from the specific nature of the underlying problem in order to drastically reduce the computational costs (memory and time) for the full fine-scale analysis of lattice structures. Our purpose is to take advantage of the natural domain decomposition into cells and, even more importantly, of the geometrical and mechanical similarities among cells. Our solver consists in a               so-called               inexact FETI-DP method where the local, cell-wise operators and solutions are approximated with reduced order modeling techniques. Instead of considering independently every cell, we end up with only few principal local problems to solve and make use of the corresponding principal cell-wise operators to approximate all the others. It results in a scalable algorithm that saves numerous local factorizations. Our solver is applied for the isogeometric analysis of lattices built by spline composition, which offers the opportunity to compute the reduced basis with macro-scale data, thereby making our method also multiscale and matrix-free. The solver is tested against various 2D and 3D analyses. It shows major gains compared to black-box solvers; in particular, problems of several millions of degrees of freedom can be solved with a simple computer within few minutes.},
