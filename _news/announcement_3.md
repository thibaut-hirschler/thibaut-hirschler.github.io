My project **DynOpt4Lattice** has been selected by the French National Research Agency! I am hiring a PhD student (fully funded) to build a nice numerical framework for designing lattice structures with optimal dynamical behavior. ðŸ‘‰â€‹ See the job offer: [english version](/assets/pdf/offre-these-english.pdf) or [french version](/assets/pdf/offre-these.pdf).
