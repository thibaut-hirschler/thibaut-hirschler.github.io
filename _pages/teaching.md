I teach in the **mechanical enginnering** department at [Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard](https://www.utbm.fr/) since 2023.

## Strength of materials and vibration

I am in charge of a course on **structural mechanics**. The students learn:
* Important principles in mechanics: linear elasticity and superposition principle, partial derivatives of mechanical energies, equilibrium equations, etc.
* How standard materials behave: strain/stress relations, pasticity, failure.
* What happend in the case of dynamic loadings: vibration modes, resonance, dynamic amplification, damping.
* How to model and predict the mechanical responses of beam-like structures in both static and vibration regimes.



## Numerical methods: the bases


## Computational mechanics

## Design method for additive manufacturing
