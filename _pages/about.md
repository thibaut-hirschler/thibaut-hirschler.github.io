**Some info about me:**
* I teach in the Mechanical Engineering department of <a href='https://www.utbm.fr/'>UniversitÃ© de Technologie de Belfort-MontbÃ©liard</a>, a french technical university located in the North-East of France. 
* I do my research at the <a href='https://icb.u-bourgogne.fr/en/home-page/homepage/'>Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne</a>, a CNRS Mixed Research Unit. I am part of a research team doing mechanics with a focus on mechanical design.
* My scientific activities are devoted to the construction of efficient numerical methods and models for designing innovative structures. 
  I do (*simple*) math and I code (*when possible*). I still think about the underlying physics time to time ðŸ˜‰.


This webpage gathers the main contents related to my research and eventually my teaching. I maintain this page mainly for me, but you might find interesting stuff here and there.
